# TechTrendsProject
# Restful API
This section of the project is where a restful api has been created and will be used to retrieve data that will later be   analyzed, it is important to know this api is connected to a cloud database and set up with proper security measures

#Report Use
This report will be used to update stakeholders on developments of the project and any and everything related to this section of the project

# API use
This API will be used by authorized users to fetch data that will be used to represent relevant information granted they have access to the token to use this API 
# Endpoints
	GET method that will retrieve one Telemetry from the database based on the ID parsed through
	POST method that will create a new Telemetry entry on the database
	PATCH method that will update an existing Telemetry entry on the database
	DELETE method that will delete an existing Telemetry entry on the database
	GET method named GetSavings in the API that queries all telemetry per project and calculates the cumulative time 
	  and cost saved
